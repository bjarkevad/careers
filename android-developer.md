# Android Developer 💚
Hey there! 👋

Are you an eager-to-learn, highly motivated, get-shit-done kind of person? Do you fancy working in a high paced tech startup that accelerates your personal development like no other place, and gives you responsibility from day one? 

Then heads up!

Undo has already kicked in the door in the insurance industry and is now looking to make even more noise. For that, we are looking for a **newly graduated** and **eager-to-learn** Android Developer to join our tech team. Is that you?


## About UNDO
With a 25 million DKK funding round in the pocket, Undo is an InsurTech start-up on a mission to change insurance as you know it. We aim to democratize insurance by making it **transparent**, **fair** and **easy**. We want to reinvent insurance as a concept by designing products and experiences that can only be realized by manoeuvring on the **bleeding edge of technology**. The result: a fast, affordable, and hassle-free digital experience, and month-on-month growth rate of 30-50% for over 6 consecutive months at the time of writing 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

As developer at UNDO you will not only join a small, ambitious, and close-knit team of developers, but also a family of 14 caring and passionate people that want to enable others to live life carefree. We're currently situated in Copenhagen @[Talent Garden Rainmaking](https://talentgarden.org/dk/campus/denmark/copenhagen-rainmaking/), but will be moving to new offices @[Spaces](https://www.spacesworks.com/da/koebenhavn/ny-carlsberg-vej/) in the newly renovated Carlsberg City District - both places pulsing with entrepreneurial spirit and drive.
